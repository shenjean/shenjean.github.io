The microbial ecology lab believes that everyone can be a scientist, and that there are various ways to be successful in science (academia and non-academia). While I don’t have the answers to all problems in science, my greatest satisfaction from teaching and mentoring is from knowing that I have piqued my students’ curiosity and interest in science, and that I have empowered them to seek the answers they need. The lab welcomes scientists and students who are creative and motivated problem-solvers interested in answering questions related to microbial ecology and OneHealth.

Currently, I am recruiting one Ph.D. student for Fall 2026. I will also be happy to discuss and develop proposals other scientists and with prospective local and international graduate students and postdocs.
