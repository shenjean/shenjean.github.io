## Extraction of high molecular weight DNA from bacterial cultures

### Pelleting bacterial cultures
* Grow a pure colony in 5mL of liquid broth
* Upon visible growth and pellet at the bottom of the tube, centrifuge the culture at 1,700 RCF for 5 minutes (preferably using a swing-bucket rotor)
* Remove the supernatant, then vortex and homogenize the pellet and transfer to a 1.5 mL/2mL microcentrifuge tube
* Centrifuge the microcentrifuge tubes at the highest speed for 5 minutes
* Remove the supernatant and use the pellet for DNA extraction
* Pellet can be stored at -80C

### DNA extraction
* Add ~250 uL of beads to a screw-top microcentrifuge tube with O-ring seal screw cap
* Vortex to homogenize the pellet, then add the mixture to the microcentrifuge tube
* Add 600 uL of RLT buffer (without beta-mercaptoethanol) from [Qiagen’s AllPrep DNA/RNA Mini kit](https://www.qiagen.com/us/products/discovery-and-translational-research/dna-rna-purification/multianalyte-and-virus/allprep-dna-rna-kits) to the microcentrifuge tube
* Bead beat at maximum speed for 10 minutes 
* Extract DNA following the protocol for [Qiagen’s AllPrep DNA/RNA Mini kit](https://www.qiagen.com/us/products/discovery-and-translational-research/dna-rna-purification/multianalyte-and-virus/allprep-dna-rna-kits)
* Elute DNA in 30-100 uL elution buffer and quantify using [Qubit](https://www.thermofisher.com/us/en/home/industrial/spectroscopy-elemental-isotope-analysis/molecular-spectroscopy/fluorometers/qubit.html)

### RNAse treatment and DNA purification
* Bring DNA sample to 100 uL
* Dissolve RNase A in DNase/RNase-free water or TE to a stock concentration of 10 mg/ml
* Add enough 10 mg/ml RNase A to the sample for a final concentration of 10-100 µg/mL and mix well
* Incubate at room temperature for 15 minutes
* Purify DNA using [Zymo Research’s Genomic DNA Clean & Concentrator-10 kit](https://www.zymoresearch.com/products/genomic-dna-clean-concentrator-10)
* Elute DNA in 30-50 uL elution buffer (target concentration is >50 ng/uL)
* Quantify and assess the quality of purified DNA using [Qubit](https://www.thermofisher.com/us/en/home/industrial/spectroscopy-elemental-isotope-analysis/molecular-spectroscopy/fluorometers/qubit.html), NanoDrop, and by running >50 ng of the DNA on a 1% agarose gel
* Send 20 uL of >50 ng/uL DNA to [Eurofins Genomics](https://eurofinsgenomics.com/en/products/nanopore-sequencing/bacterial-genome-sequencing/) for bacterial genomic sequencing on the Nanopore platform
