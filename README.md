The microbial ecology lab studies host-microbe-environment interactions in marine ecosystems and in humans. 
We integrate field, laboratory, and ‘omics approaches to understand the interplay between microbes (bacteria, viruses, and fungi), host health, and environmental health. Volunteers, collaborators, and fellowship applications are welcome!

## Current projects
**Investigating the feasibility of co-restoration of seagrass and native clams in Florida**

💼 Recruiting REU/undergraduate students and a postdoc/lab-technician

This project uses a combination of field work, microbiology/molecular biology techniques, and bioinformatics data analysis to investigate the microbial diversity in Florida's seagrass habitats in association with lucinid bivalve (clam) abundance, beneficial bacteria (symbionts), nutrient composition, and seagrass health. Results will inform the development of a novel, scalable strategy and a best practices guide for seagrass-clam co-restoration.
